# JavaScript Design Patterns

Summary notes for [Learning Patterns By Lydia Hallie and Addy Osmani](https://www.patterns.dev/).

## Introduction

Design patterns are a fundamental part of software development, as they provide typical solutions to commonly recurring problems in software design. Rather than providing specific pieces of software, design patterns are merely concepts that can be used to handle recurring themes in an optimized way.

This project covers the implementation, benefits and pitfalls of common design patterns using ES2015+, React-specific design patterns and their possible modifications and implementation using React Hooks. and many more patterns and optimizations that can help improve your modern web app!
